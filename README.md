# Using Data For Social Impact (USDI): Data Wrangling and Modeling in R

## Overview
Welcome to the USDI workshop on Data Wrangling and Modeling in R! This workshop is designed to enhance your skills in data manipulation, analysis, and modeling using the R programming language. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced R user, this workshop will provide valuable insights into leveraging government and NGO real-life data for social impact and causal inference analysis.

## Workshop Goals
By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Gain hands-on experience in data manipulation using R.
- Learn advanced techniques for data analysis and modeling.
- Understand how to work with real-life datasets from government and NGO sectors.
- Learn causal inference analysis techniques using R.


## Workshop Materials
- `USDI-Training-4.pdf`: The main R pdf document containing the workshop content.
- `USDI-Training-4.Rmd`: The main R Markdown document providing you access to the material and enabling you to run the codes independently.
- `officew.csv`: Sample dataset used for data manipulation exercises.


## Setting up R and RStudio
To get started with the workshop, you need to install R and RStudio on your computer. Follow the installation instructions below:

### Installation Instructions
RStudio is a software commonly used by R practitioners to develop code in R. We will use RStudio to go through the workshop materials, which requires the installation of both the R language and the RStudio software. If you would like to run R on your own computer, complete the following steps prior to the workshop:

#### 2.1 Download R
- Follow the links according to the operating system you are running.
- Download the package and install R onto your computer. Install the most recent version (at least version 4.1).
  - For macOS: [Download R for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
  - For Windows: [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)

#### 2.2 Download R Studio
- Install RStudio Desktop. This should be free. Do this after you have already installed R.
  - [Download RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

#### 2.3 Use R on the Cloud
- Try PositCloud if you don’t have the resources to download R and RStudio on your system. Simply start a new project and you’ll be taken to the interface. However, it's recommended to download R and RStudio on your system if you don’t have constant access to the internet and want to work with local files. Additionally, the free version of the cloud platform is restricted.

## Getting Started with GitHub
GitHub is a platform where you can host and collaborate on code repositories. To get started with using GitHub and access the workshop materials, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: 
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
git clone https://github.com/abiola1864/UDSI.git



2. **Navigate to the Downloaded Repository**:
After cloning the repository, navigate to the downloaded directory using the `cd` command:
cd UDSI


3. **Open the Workshop Materials**:
- Open the `USDI-Training-4.Rmd` file in RStudio to start working with the workshop materials.
- You can also explore other files such as `USDI-Training-4.pdf` for reading the workshop content and `officew.csv` for sample datasets used in exercises.
